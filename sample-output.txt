--- FINAL ANSWER ---
Here are the key contributions of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr to quantum mechanics, along with the years of their discoveries:

### Max Planck
- **Quantum Hypothesis (1900)**: Planck introduced the concept of quantization of energy, proposing that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete units called "quanta."
- **Quantum Theory of Black-Body Radiation (1900)**: He developed a theoretical framework to explain black-body radiation, which laid the groundwork for quantum mechanics.

### Albert Einstein
- **Photoelectric Effect (1905)**: Einstein proposed that light can be thought of as consisting of particles called photons, which can eject electrons from a material when they collide with it. This work provided crucial evidence for the quantum theory of light.

### Niels Bohr
- **Bohr Model of the Atom (1913)**: Bohr introduced a new model for the atom, which described electrons orbiting the nucleus in quantized energy levels. This model explained the spectral lines of hydrogen and was pivotal in the development of quantum theory.

These contributions were foundational in the establishment of quantum mechanics as a significant field of physics.
