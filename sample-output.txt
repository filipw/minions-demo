--- FINAL ANSWER ---
Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr each made foundational contributions to the development of quantum mechanics:

- Max Planck (1900) introduced the quantum hypothesis, proposing that energy emitted by atomic systems is quantized and can be divided into discrete units called "energy elements" or quanta. This idea laid the groundwork for the concept of quantization in physics.

- Albert Einstein (1905) extended Planck's concept by explaining the photoelectric effect, demonstrating that light itself is quantized into particles called photons. This work provided critical evidence for the quantum nature of light and helped establish quantum theory.

- Niels Bohr (1913) developed a new atomic model in which electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy levels or orbits. Bohr's model successfully explained the discrete spectral lines observed in the hydrogen atom, further validating the quantum approach to atomic structure.

Together, these contributions formed key pillars of early quantum mechanics, shaping our understanding of energy quantization, the particle nature of light, and atomic structure.
